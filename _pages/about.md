Hello, my name is Long, (or you can call me Lucas). I am currently a senior studying at Macalester College in the state of Minnesota. My major is Computer Science and minors are Maths and Statistics. I am especially interested in the intersection of technology and mathematics, and I believe that technology products can help transform everyone's lives. I am doing an internship as a part-time SWE for Revestify. Revestify is working hard to deliver a fast and efficient software solution to Church remmitment.
